how to send money to yourself using two Google pay accounts with the same legal name but different email addresses to instantly cash out money to a physical Robinhood debit card to make trading stocks and options instant instead of waiting 5 days for ACH deposit from a checking account

```
one Google pay account should consist of the email receiving a payment to cash out to a physical Robinhood debit card

your other self based email should consist of the Debit card you own for funding your Robinhood account

the email linked to Google pay with your bank debit should have your physical cell phone

the email linked to the Robinhood debit card should have the TextNow phone number linked
(TextNow charges $5 a year for the ability to even receive SMS text messages (to be able to get 6 digit one time pin confirms)
